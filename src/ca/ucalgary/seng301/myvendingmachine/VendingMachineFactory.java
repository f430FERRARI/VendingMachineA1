/**
 * This class allows a set of scripts to be read in, executed, and evaluated for
 * correctness. It acts as the frontend of the vending machine system. The
 * backend is not yet implemented. For the methods in the class, each has a
 * "TODO" comment to indicate that you are to replace or to add its
 * implementation, with the exception of the constructor which you should
 * probably leave alone in your best interests.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The frontend includes a parser for the scripts that you do not need to worry
 * about. You have not been given its source code because it is a bit
 * complicated and not the point of the assignment.
 * 
 * <h2>Vending machines</h2>
 * 
 * Construction. The vending machines have a set of one or more selection
 * buttons and operate on a set of one or more coin kinds (these details cannot
 * be changed once the machine is constructed). Each coin kind has a unique,
 * positive integer value.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Configuration. Each of the selection buttons corresponds to a kind of pop.
 * The name of each kind of pop and its price can be specified (and changed).
 * Selection buttons can share the same name or the same price or both.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Loading and unloading. The machine can be loaded with a set of coins (for
 * change) and a set of pops (to be sold). These can be unloaded from the
 * machine at any time, along with any money that has been used to buy pops.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Purchasing. Purchasing occurs by inserting an appropriate number of coins
 * into the machine and pressing the appropriate button. If the value of the
 * coins is sufficient to pay for the pop, the pop is dispensed and any change
 * owing is returned. If the desired kind of pop is empty, nothing is returned
 * and the state does not change. If the cost is higher than the value entered,
 * nothing is returned and the state does not change. There is no coin return
 * button on this version of the machine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Extracting pop and change. Pops and change are delivered to a delivery chute.
 * These need to be extracted explicitly, else they remain there, accumulating.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Checking. The contents extracted from the delivery chute and the contents
 * extracted from inside the machine can be checked against expectations. The
 * frontend is implemented to deal with this when the commands are issued to do
 * so.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Physical limits. This simulation does not need to be realistic, in that no
 * physical limits are imposed. An effectively boundless number of coins and
 * pops can exist, be moved around, and be stored.
 * 
 * <h2>The Scripts</h2>
 * 
 * Scripts support a simple language consisting of 9 commands.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In the syntax below, tokens are specified as surrounded by quotation marks
 * and as the special token kinds &lt;STRING&gt; and &lt;INTEGER&gt;. Zero or
 * more characters of whitespace (i.e., blank spaces, tabs, carriage returns,
 * etc.) can appear between tokens, as in Java. A &lt;STRING&gt; represents a
 * string literal, which is any sequence of characters surrounded by quotation
 * marks; a backslash is used as an escape character to permit certain special
 * characters to be used in a manner identical to Java. An &lt;INTEGER&gt;
 * represents an integer literal which is either the numeral 0 or any numeral in
 * the range 1-9 followed by zero or more numerals each in the range 0-9.
 *
 * <h3>The construct command</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Syntax:</b>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * "construct" "(" &lt;INTEGER&gt; { "," &lt;INTEGER&gt; } ";" &lt;INTEGER&gt; ")"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This command takes a sequence of comma-separated integers each representing a
 * valid coin kind; there must be at least one valid coin kind. The integer
 * represents the value of the coin kind; each coin kind must have a unique
 * value. Each value must be a positive integer. The final, semicolon-separated
 * integer represents the number of selection buttons; it must be a positive
 * integer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose:</b>
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this command is to create a vending machine object with the
 * specified characteristics. The created vending machine remains current until
 * and unless another vending machine is created. It is an error to issue any
 * other command prior to construction of a vending machine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Correct examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(1; 1) // 1 coin kind of value "1"; 1 selection button
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(10, 1, 3; 5) // 3 coin kinds of values "10", "1", "3" <b>in that order</b>; 5 selection buttons
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(1, 3, 10; 5) // 3 coin kinds of values "1", "3", "10" <b>in that order</b>; 5 selection buttons
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(1 ; 1) configure("" ; 1)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Incorrect examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct() // error: no coin kinds, no selection buttons
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(0; 0) // error: coin values are not positive, selection button count is not positive
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(1 2 3; 4) // error: commas missing
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(1, 2, 3; 4 // error: closing parenthesis missing
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * configure("" ; 100) construct(1; 1) // command issue prior to first construct
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>The configure command</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Syntax:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * "configure" "(" &lt;STRING&gt; { "," &lt;STRING&gt; } ";" &lt;INTEGER&gt; { "," &lt;INTEGER&gt;} ")"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This command takes a sequence of comma-separated strings each of which is
 * surrounded by double quotation marks (e.g., "this is a string"). A semicolon
 * follows these strings, followed by a sequence of comma-separated integers.
 * There must be at least one string and one integer present. Each integer must
 * be positive.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose:</b>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this command is to configure a vending machine with the names
 * of the products and the prices that correspond to each selection button. It
 * is an error if the number of strings or the number of integers specified is
 * not identical to the number of selection buttons specified in the most recent
 * construct command.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Correct examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * configure(""; 1)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * configure("", ""; 1, 1)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Incorrect examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * configure() // error: no strings
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * configure(a) // error: no quotation marks
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(1; 1) configure("", "") // error: too many strings
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>The load command</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Syntax:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * "load" "(" &lt;INTEGER&gt; { "," &lt;INTEGER&gt; } ";" &lt;INTEGER&gt; { "," &lt;INTEGER&gt; } ")"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This command takes a sequence of comma-separated integers; there must be at
 * least one of them. Then, a semicolon indicates the start of another sequence
 * of comma-separated integers. All these values must be non-negative. It is an
 * error if the number of integers in the first sequence is not identical to the
 * number of coin kinds for the current vending machine. It is an error if the
 * number of integers in the second sequence is not identical to the number of
 * selection buttons for the current vending machine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose:</b>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this command is to load the vending machine with a set of
 * coins for change and with a set of pop cans.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Correct examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(1; 1) load(0; 0) // 0 coins of value "1", 0 pops of kind 1
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(3, 2, 1; 2) load(1, 0, 0; 1, 1) // 1 coin of value "3", none of "2" and none of "1"; 1 pop of kind 1, 1 pop of kind 2
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Incorrect examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * load(0) // error: two sets of sequences are required
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * load(-1; -1) // error: negative values are not allowed
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(3, 2, 1; 2) load(1, 0, 0; 1) // error: the quantity of pop kind 2 is not specified
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>The unload command</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Syntax:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * "unload" "(" ")"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose:</b>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This command causes the total value of remaining unused coins, total value of
 * payment coins, and individual names of unsold pops to be unloaded from the
 * interior of the machine (for checking).
 * 
 * <h3>The extract command</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Syntax:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * "extract" "(" ")"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose:</b>
 * <p>
 * This command causes the current contents of the delivery chute to be removed
 * from the vending machine (for checking).
 * 
 * <h3>The insert command</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Syntax:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * "insert" "(" &lt;INTEGER&gt; ")"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * An error will occur if the integer is not positive. The coin will immediately
 * be deposited in the delivery chute if its value does not correspond to a coin
 * kind supported by the current vending machine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose:</b>
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this command is to insert a coin of the specified value into
 * the machine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Correct examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(1; 1) insert(1)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(5; 1) insert(1) // the coin is immediately returned
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Incorrect examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * insert(0) // error: non-positive coin
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * insert() // error: no coin
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>The press command</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Syntax:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * "press" "(" &lt;INTEGER&gt; ")"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The integer has to be non-negative. It is an error if the integer is greater
 * than or equal to the number of pop selection buttons for the current vending
 * machine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose:</b>
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this command is to simulate the press of a pop selection
 * button.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Correct examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(1; 1) press(0)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Incorrect examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * press() // Error: no button indicated
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * press(-1) // Error: number is negative
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * construct(1 ; 1) press(1) // Error: button number is out of range
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>The CHECK_DELIVERY command</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Syntax:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * "CHECK_DELIVERY" "(" &lt;INTEGER&gt; { "," &lt;STRING&gt; } ")"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This command is used to check whether your vending machine behaves as
 * expected. This command does not communicate with your vending machine, but
 * checks whether it has already delivered what is expected.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose:</b>
 * <p>
 * The integer indicates the expected total value of all coins delivered (for
 * example, as change). The sequence of strings indicates the kinds of pop that
 * are expected to have been delivered.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Correct examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * CHECK_DELIVERY(0)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * CHECK_DELIVERY(0, &quot;Coke&quot;)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>The CHECK_TEARDOWN command</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Syntax:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * "CHECK_TEARDOWN" "(" &lt;INTEGER&gt; ";" &lt;INTEGER&gt; [ ";" &lt;STRING&gt; { "," &lt;STRING&gt; } ] ")"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose:</b>
 * <p>
 * This command is used to check what is still inside the vending machine. The
 * first number indicates the total value of the change still remaining for use.
 * The second number indicates the total value of the coins entered as payment.
 * The two numbers are separated by a semicolon. A sequence of comma-separated
 * strings can follow these numbers. If present, it is separated by a semicolon.
 * Each string represents a kind of pop that is expected to be found.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Correct examples:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * CHECK_TEARDOWN(0; 0; "Coke", "Water")
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * CHECK_TEARDOWN(1; 100)
 * </pre>
